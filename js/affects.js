/*
 * Describes an "affect", something that temporarily (or sometimes,
 * permanently) modifies a characteristic of an actor. (Usually in the form of
 * a buff spell)
 *
 * An affect has two phases
 *
 * 1) Activation: the player casts a spell or does something to activate the
 *    buff, debuff, or whatever. The activation function is passed two
 *    arguments: the actor and whether the actor already has the affect. The
 *    latter is passed because usually you don't want to apply the affect
 *    twice, you just want to extend the duration.
 *
 * 2) Deactivation: the affect wears off. This function should undo whatever
 *    the activation function did. (Or not, which results in a permanent
 *    affect.)
 *    
 * 
 * Only the Affect.addAffect(actor, affectName) function should be used to
 * add affects to actors. All possible affects (referred to by affectName)
 * should be defined in the object Affect.affects.
 */

define([], function() {
  /*
   * There are two rules to writing affects:
   *
   * The activate and deactivate functions *usually* should be inverses of each
   * other unless there is a desired side effect.  For example, if you have a
   * "strength" affect and activate does +2 str, deactivate should do -2 str.
   *
   * Another rule: DON'T MIX DIFFERENT KINDS OF OPERATIONS. if you have an
   * affect that adds to str and removes from str, EVERY affect must only ADD
   * and SUBTRACT str (or leave it) same. To see why, imagine affects A and B.
   * A grants +2 str and B doubles str and both reverse their effect properly.
   * The player has 15 str and activates A, giving him 17 str. Now, he
   * activates B and has 34 str. Affect A runs out, so he is left with only 32
   * str, and affect B runs out, leaving him with 16 str, erroneously gaining a
   * point of str in the process. You cannot mix multiplication and addition
   * unless you can 100% guarantee that the options will expire like a stack:
   * gain A, gain B, lose B, lose A which is not how roguelike affects work.
