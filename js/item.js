/*
 * This code describes an item.
 *
 * There are two kinds of items: regular items and attractions.
 *
 * Regular items (instances of Item): stuff that can be picked up, like weapons, armor, rings,
 * trash, etc.
 *
 * Attractions (instances of Attraction): stuff that cannot be picked up but may have some effect. Gold
 * might seem like an item initially but the actual "item" can't be picked up,
 * rather when you step on the tile you gain as much gold as the item is worth.
 *
 * What happens when the player steps on an item's tile is determined by the
 * item's announce() function.
